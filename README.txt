1.	Initialization:
	•	Pygame Initialization: Initialize Pygame modules and set up the screen dimensions (screen_width and screen_height).
	2.	Game States:
	•	Define different states for the game using constants (MAIN_MENU, MATH_QUIZ, MATH_MEMORY, ARITHMETIC_SEQUENCE). These states control the flow of the game and what is displayed to the user.
	3.	Main Menu:
	•	Display a main menu using Pygame’s event loop (main_menu() function).
	•	Render menu options (Math Quiz, Math Memory, Arithmetic Sequence) and wait for user input to select a game.
	4.	Math Quiz Game:
	•	Generate random arithmetic questions (math_quiz() function).
	•	Display each question dynamically and accept user input for answers.
	•	Evaluate correctness of answers and display the final score.
	5.	Math Memory Game:
	•	Present a sequence of numbers briefly to the user (math_memory() function).
	•	Prompt the user to recall and enter the sequence.
	•	Compare user-entered sequence with the original sequence to determine correctness.
	6.	Arithmetic Sequence Game:
	•	Create incomplete arithmetic sequences with a missing number (arithmetic_sequence() function).
	•	Display choices and allow the user to select the correct missing number.
	•	Provide feedback on correctness and allow retry if incorrect.
	7.	Rendering and Event Handling:
	•	Use Pygame’s rendering functions (draw_text()) to display text and game elements on the screen.
	•	Handle user input events (keyboard keys) to interact with the games (pygame.event.get()).
	8.	Main Function:
	•	Control the main flow of the program using a loop (main() function).
	•	Switch between game states based on user interaction and game completion.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python: Core programming language used for game logic and interaction.
	•	Pygame: Library used for graphics rendering, event handling, and game development.
	•	Development Environment: Integrated Pygame with core Python functionalities to create interactive educational games.
